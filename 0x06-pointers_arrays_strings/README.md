# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

## General
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

## Tasks

- function that concatenates two strings. function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of  dest, and then adds a terminating null byte Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
- function that concatenates two strings. The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src;   and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
- function that copies a string.
- function that compares two strings.
- function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- function that capitalizes all words of a string.
- function that encodes a string into 1337.
 - Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
 - Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
 - Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
 - Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
 - Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
 - Prototype: char *leet(char *);
